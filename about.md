Hello!
My name is Connor Lucket.
I am a software engineer for Arista.

I received my Sc.M. in [Computer Science at Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu/) while working with the [Brown Database Group](https://brownbigdata.github.io/).
I completed my undergraduate studies at [Austin College in Sherman, TX](https://www.austincollege.edu/) with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor in Physics.

I love bicycles, airplanes, and music.
[I'm currently building a Thatcher CX4](https://connorcx4.wordpress.com), which is a single-seat aluminum airplane built from plans and powered by a converted VW Beetle engine.
I am also slowly working on a design I call the Warbler, to fit in the LSA category of aircraft.

Also, my cat's name is Sir Isaac Newton.
