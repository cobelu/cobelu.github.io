Hello!
My name is Connor Lucket.
I am a first-year Ph.D. student studying [Computer Science at Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu/), working with the [Brown Database Group](https://brownbigdata.github.io/).
I work on making distributed databases more efficient.

I completed my undergraduate studies at [Austin College in Sherman, TX](https://www.austincollege.edu/) with a double major in computer science and mathematics and a minor in physics.
I love bicycles, airplanes, and music.
Also, my cat's name is Sir Isaac Newton.
