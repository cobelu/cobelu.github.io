## Software Engineer

Currently, I am a Software Engineer on the Data Team for the NDR division of Arista.
We primarily work in Scala (which I hope to write a bit more about on this site).

## Graduate Teaching Assistant

I was the Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) for Brown's CSCI 1270 Database Management Systems for the Fall semester of 2021.
The entire course was refactored for this semester.
We now have coding assinments implemented in Golang, which allow students to get a better glimpse through the black box.
We have also worked hard to write new written homework questions in order to better serve the students.
I am incredibly thankful for the hard work of all of the TAs for the course.

## Graduate Research Assistant

I have been a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) in the Brown Database Group since June of 2019.
In the past I have worked on distributed databases, specifically determining their applicability for wimpy clusters.
Now, I consider how aspects of GDPR compliance can be achieved via "bolt-on" mechanisms.

## Data Science

In the summer of 2018 I worked under Dr. Gourab Ghoshal at the University of Rochester.
I picked up the UNIX shell, PostgreSQL, and pandas.
I wrote a python package to create driving routes between urban amenities.
It fetched information from an OpenStreetMap database configured with the PostGIS and pgRouting extensions.
We analyzed possible relationships between amenity distances and income data in various urban areas.

## Tutoring

I tutored a number of middle school students in the Fall semester of 2017.
This was made possible by a generous NOYCE grant from the NSF given to Austin College.
The purpose of the NOYCE grant was to send undergraduates into the community as advocates for STEM.
It was an incredibly rewarding experience to say the least.

## Materials Science

My materials science research involved nanoscale gold thin films.
I used a cryogenic freezer to cool samples to frigid temperatures, where I could collect resistivity measurements with LabView.
We confirmed results that gold can exhibit resistivity versus temperature behavior like a semiconductor.
Thanks to Dr. Manuel Quevedo-Lopez at the University of Texas at Dallas for allowing us to utilize UTD's lab equipment.
