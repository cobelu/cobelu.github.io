## Graduate Teaching Assistant

I am the Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) for Brown's CSCI 1270 Database Management Systems for the Fall semester of 2021.
The entire course was refactored for this semester.
We now have coding assinments implemented in Golang, which allow students to get a better glimpse through the black box.
We have also worked hard to write new written homework questions, which better serve the students.
I am incredibly thankful for the hard work of all of the TAs for the course.

## Graduate Research Assistant

I have been a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) in the Brown Database Group since June of 2019.
In the past I have worked on distributed databases, specifically determining their applicability for wimpy clusters.
Now, I consider how aspects of GDPR compliance can be achieved via "bolt-on" mechanisms.

## Data Science

In the summer of 2018 I worked under Dr. Gourab Ghoshal at the University of Rochester.
I picked up the UNIX shell, PostgreSQL, and pandas.
I wrote a python package to create driving routes between urban amenities.
It fetched information from an OpenStreetMap database configured with the PostGIS and pgRouting extensions.
We analyzed possible relationships between amenity distances and income data in various urban areas.

## Tutoring

Austin College received a NOYCE grant from the NSF in order to send students out as tutors for local schools in STEM subjects.
I worked as a math tutor at my local middle school in the fall of 2017, primarily working with 7th graders.
It was an incredibly rewarding experience to say the least.

## Materials Science

My materials science research involved nanoscale gold thin films. I used a cryogenic freezer to cool samples to frigid temperatures, where I could collect resistivity measurements. Data collection was done with LabView. Thanks to Dr. Manuel Quevedo-Lopez at the University of Texas at Dallas for allowing us to utilize UTD's lab equipment.
