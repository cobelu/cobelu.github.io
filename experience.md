## Software Engineer

Currently, I am a Software Engineer on the Data Team for the NDR division of Arista.
We primarily work in Scala (which I hope to write a bit more about on this site).
We make threat researcher easy and more productive by providing them with an awesome threat-hunting tool.

## Graduate Teaching Assistant

I was the Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) for Brown's CSCI 1270 Database Management Systems for the Fall semester of 2021.
We moved from Java to Golang, and created new assignments, which gave students a full soup-to-nuts creation of a mini database.
It was a complete (and rewarding) overhaul.

## Graduate Research Assistant

I was a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) in the Brown Database Group from June 2019 to December 2022.
In that previous life, I worked on distributed databases, specifically determining their applicability for wimpy clusters.
Later, I considered how aspects of GDPR compliance could be achieved via "bolt-on" mechanisms.

## Data Science

In the summer of 2018 I worked under Dr. Gourab Ghoshal at the University of Rochester.
I analyzed driving routes between urban amenities with Python and pandas.
It fetched information from an OpenStreetMap database configured with the PostGIS and pgRouting extensions.
Specifically, we examined relationships between distances to various amenities and socioeconomic data for a selection of American cities.

## Tutoring

I tutored a number of middle school students in the Fall semester of 2017.
This was made possible by a generous NOYCE grant from the NSF given to Austin College.
The purpose of the NOYCE grant was to send undergraduates into the community as advocates for STEM.
It was an incredibly rewarding experience to say the least.

## Materials Science

As an undergraduate researcher, I spent Summer and Fall of 2016 examining nanoscale gold thin films.
I wrote LabView programs to measure resistivity of gold nano-films to look for semiconductor-like behavior.
We confirmed results that gold can exhibit resistivity per temperature behavior similar to that of a semiconductor.
We were fortunate to partner with Dr. Manuel Quevedo-Lopez at the University of Texas at Dallas for allowing us to utilize their lab equipment.
