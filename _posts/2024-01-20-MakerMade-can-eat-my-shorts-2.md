It didn't get better.

## And The Verdict Is...

[I stand by my previous opinion: this thing is absolute garbage](https://cobelu.com/MakerMade-can-eat-my-shorts).

The best argument for a Maslow is that it's the cheapest way to get a 4'x8' cutting area.
However, you can easily build a LowRider v3.
It will cut faster with more precision.
There's absolutely no good reason to buy a Maslow, and there's even less of a reason to buy an M2.

I want to be clear: there are lots of things in life that can be well worth your patience.
This is not one of those things.

## Calibration Went Worse Than Expected

One week, I finally got a chance to try calibration with the M2.

If you're curious what the calibration results were, I recorded them.

| Round | Accuracy (mm) |
|---|---|
| 1 | 77.2 |
| 2 | 63.7 |
| 3 | 47.3 |

As shown, I completed 3 full rounds of calibration.
I expected this process to be slow and painful.
It was.
I was still cuttng with an accuracy of roughly 2" after *three* rounds of calibration.

I understand that I need patience, but this is unreasonable.
I realized: *this was not worth my time*.
By extension, this is not worth *your* time.
Yup, this thing is garbage.

## Into The Garbage It Goes

Most of my MakerMade M2 went into the trash can... where it belongs.
