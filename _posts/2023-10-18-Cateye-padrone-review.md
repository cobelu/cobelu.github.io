## Plan for Your Use Case

I needed a new bike computer, so I ordered a new one.
What a mistake!
There's no need to replace something that works fine.
I settled on a Cateye Padrone.
It had a large screen, I trusted the Cateye brand, and it had good reviews.
I regret the purchase.

## Problem

The Cateye Padrone showed a speed of 0 mph for any speed.

## Fix 1

The manual states that the maximum distance between the pickup and computer is 27".
Believe it or not, it's very possible to be outside of this limit.
I reviewed the manual and realized the system needed some adjustment.
I scooted the magnet closer to the rim of the wheel, so I could move the pickup farther up the fork to be closer to the computer.
Still, the Padrone didn't register any speed.

## Fix 2

In order to mount a light, I moved the Padrone from the handlebar to the stem.
This positioned it about another 1/2" to 1" closer to the pickup.
I realized that, *I was suddenly getting consistent speed readings*.
Problem solved!

## Fix 3

On my ride to work, *the speed immediately went back to 0 mph*.
I couldn't believe it.
It upset me so much that I turned off the music playing on my phone.
That's when I realized what the problem is.

## Solution

*The Padrone's readings are impacted by phone speakers*!
Don't believe me?
Try it for yourself.
I can turn the phone on, and the speed will drop to 0 mph.
Turn it off, and it goes back to working perfectly normal.
*Don't buy one of these if you plan to listen to music from your phone while you ride*.

## Lesson Learned

TEST! TEST! TEST!
It does matter!
Think about how your user will use the product.
Use your product!
I still prefer the Cateye brand for bike computers, but I'm incredibly surprised that their engineering team did not expect a cyclist to listen to music while they ride.

## Disclaimer

I did get a refund from Cateye (before I fully found the solution).
