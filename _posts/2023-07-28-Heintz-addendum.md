## Chris Heintz's Self-Help Book for Wannabe Aeronautical Engineers

I have made so many notes in my personal copy of *Flying on Your Own Wings* by Chris Heintz.
Last weekend, I spoke with another EAA member who was interested in designing his own plane.
He asked my friend with an RV-12 project about the weight of the wing panels.
I noted that Chris Heintz's book had some good estimation formulas for that.
Then, I noted how the book had several errors, even though it's on the third edition.

[Thus, I decided to write an addendum to Heintz's book, which you can download here](assets/images/posts/2023/07/HeintzCorrections.pdf).
Of course, it's written in Latex.
After all... I didn't go to grad school to write documents in Word!

I'm happy to mark other corrections and clarifications as submitted.
If you've read the book and made notes, please consider syncing with me.
