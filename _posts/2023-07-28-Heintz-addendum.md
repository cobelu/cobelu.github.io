## Notes on *Flying on Your Own Wings*

I have made so many notes in my personal copy of *Flying on Your Own Wings* by Chris Heintz.
I have at least 100 hours reading this book.
When I first moved to California and couldn't actively build an airplane,
I spent all of my time looking into airplane design,
and I read this book *a lot*.

I first attempted to read it in the 8th grade (the 2nd edition was the current edition at the time)
because I wanted to be an aeronautical engineer when I was a kid,
but I couldn't make sense of the math then to get through the book.
Years later, I tried to get through several other textbooks on aircraft design,
but none of them made any sense to me.
I knew the math, the structures, the fluids, but I didn't understand how to relate them to aircraft design.

So I revisited Chris' book, which ignores the complicated stuff you don't need to worry about when you're starting out.
Then, the more complicated things finally started making sense.
To be clear: this is *the* book I recommend to anyone interested in getting started with the process of aircraft design.
Heintz revolutionized aircraft homebuilding, and to this day I strongly feel it is the right way to design:
simple, cost-effective, pragmatic.

Last weekend, I spoke with another EAA member who was interested in designing his own plane.
He asked my friend with an RV-12 project about the weight of the wing panels.
I noted that Chris Heintz's book had some good estimation formulas for that.
In fact, his book has great estimation formulas for... well... just about everything to get going on a new design.
About that time, I realized that I had several notes in my copy,
and it would probably be a wise idea to write them down if I ever lost it.

[That's why I wrote my notes to Heintz's book (3rd edition), which you can download here](assets/images/posts/2023/07/HeintzCorrections.pdf).
It's written in LaTeX to make writing formulas easier, but the source code is here in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ncwgcqtqwsxp#ca596e).

If you've worked through the book and also made notes that you feel are worthwhile to add, please consider syncing with me.
I'm happy to mark other corrections and clarifications as submitted.
