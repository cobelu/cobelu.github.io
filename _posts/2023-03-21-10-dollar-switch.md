## TL;DR

Do small, menial tasks when you're bored, especially if they improve the lives of others.

## Background

I've been volunteering my time by helping on a project at EAA Chapter 119, a Q-200 dubbed "Duckie".
I learned that the chapter's bandsaw, sitting in the corner, was not functioning.
Why?
Because the switch, which also functions as a fuse, was burnt out.

How long was it like that?
Who can say?
However, the fix was simple:
a 5 minute job.

However, when I plugged in the bandsaw *before* swapping the switch, I realized that the old switch was perfectly fine.
The band saw blade was not on the pulleys.
When I put the blade back on the pulleys, the blade did not *stay* on the pulley because it was very much out of alignment.

## Lessons Learned

**How many times have you been held back by a five-minute job of a "$10 switch"?**
I'm a young engineer, but I already have experiences with this.
Plenty of companies love to ignore their tooling.
There will always be talks of deadlines, but there's almost never any talk of the five-minute jobs that  make the engineers' lives *so much better*.

Shortly after I started my first software engineering job, we implemented a "Tech-Debt Friday".
We would spend just one dedicated hour every Friday to cleanup tech-debt, remove dead code, and rewrite documentation.
This is an example of a $10 switch job:
going slightly out of your way order to have *compounded* productivity in the future.

## Where Is He Going with This?

There are many people in Silicon Valley that scream for and against tech-debt.
This is as much of a waste of time as Tabs v. Spaces.
Focus on what actually matters:
making great things that *you* can be proud of.
So what are you waiting for?
Make a mess and make mistakes, but also be ready to grab a broom to clean up after yourself when you're finished.
